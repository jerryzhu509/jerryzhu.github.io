<center> Assignment #1 - Don't Fear the OOP!<br>The objective is to, through the creation of a storyline, try to illustrate Objected-Oriented Programming through real-life using a combination of plain English, Pseudocode, and Java code.

<center> Assignment #2 - Egg. <a class = "whiteText" href = "https://github.com/jerryzhu509/OOP1">Go to Assignment 2</a><br>The objective is to code a superclass and its derived subclasses to demostrate, mainly, the inheritance and abstraction aspects of OOP. </center>
<center>Sample Output: </center><br>

<center>To explain, the Egg is the superclass from which the rest of the classes(subclasses), ChickenEgg, Chicken..., are derived. The Main class acts as the driver class that creates objects from the different classes. Egg has attritutes like general attributes age, size, etc. that is generalized for all of the subclasses. The subclass has attributes specific for the classes. For example, Chicken has an ArrayList of Eggs has its children. This attribute is specific to the Chicken class because other classes do not have children.</center>
